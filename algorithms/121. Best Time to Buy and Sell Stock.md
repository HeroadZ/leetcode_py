Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

### Example
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
```

### Solution

max subarray problem 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices: return 0
        
        minimum = prices[0]
        ans = 0
        
        for e in prices:
            minimum = min(minimum, e)
            ans = max(ans, e-minimum)
        return ans
    
    # kadane's algorithm
    def maxProfit2(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_here = max_so_far = 0

        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            max_here = max(0, max_here + prices[i] - prices[i-1])
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_here)
            
        return max_so_far
```
