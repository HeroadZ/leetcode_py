Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

### Example
```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

### Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # brute force
    def getIntersectionNode1(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        while headA:
            tmp = headB
            while tmp:
                if headA == tmp:
                    return tmp
                else:
                    tmp = tmp.next
            headA = headA.next
        return None
    
    # hash table O(m) or O(n) space
    def getIntersectionNode2(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        d = {}
        while headA:
            d[headA] = headA
            headA = headA.next
        while headB:
            if headB in d:
                return headB
            headB = headB.next
        return None
    
    # two pointer (iterate both list, after the second iteration, they will finally meet)
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        pa, pb = headA, headB
        while pa != pb:
            pa = headB if pa is None else pa.next
            pb = headA if pb is None else pb.next
        return pa
    
```
