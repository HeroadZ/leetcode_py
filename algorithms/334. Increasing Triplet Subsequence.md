Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:

> Return true if there exists i, j, k
> such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.

Note: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

### Example
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true

Input: [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution: 
    # the value of first might not be the correct one but still works 
    # because there will alwasy be a value less than second  
    def increasingTriplet1(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first = second = sys.maxsize
        for x in nums:
            if x <= first:
                first = x
            elif x <= second:
                second = x
            else:
                return True
        return False
    
    # generalization of longest increasing subsequence
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return self.increasingSubsequence(nums, 3)
        
        
    # LBYL(look before you leap) way for longest increasing Subsequence
    def increasingSubsequence(self, nums, k):
        inc = [float('inf')] * (k - 1)
        for x in nums:
            i = bisect.bisect_left(inc, x)
            if i >= k - 1:
                return True
            inc[i] = x
        return k == 0
    
    # EAFP(easier to ask for forgiveness than permission)
    def increasingSubsequence(self, nums, k):
        try:
            inc = [float('inf')] * (k - 1)
            for x in nums:
                inc[bisect.bisect_left(inc, x)] = x
            return k == 0
        except:
            return True
