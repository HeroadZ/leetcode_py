Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### Example
```md
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true

Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

### Solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if p and q:
            return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        return p is q
        # is means the reference is same
        # For example, p == None and q == None, p is q return True
        # In other situation, return False
```
