Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

### Example
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
```

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

### Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    # inorder iterative O(n)
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        res, stack = [], []
        
        while root or stack:
            if root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            else:
                root = stack.pop()
                res.append(root.val)
                root = root.right
        
        return res[k-1]
```
