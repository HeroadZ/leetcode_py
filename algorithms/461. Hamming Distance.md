The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

### Example
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

```

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        return bin(x^y).count('1')
```
