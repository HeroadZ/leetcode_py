Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

### Example
```
Input: 1->2
Output: false

Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true
```

Follow up:
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

### Solution

first find the middle node, and reverse the second half, then compare the first and second half.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    # array reverse O(n) space
    def isPalindrome1(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        a = []
        while head:
            a.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
            
        return a == a[::-1]
    
    # O(1) space
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        fast = slow = head
        # find the middle
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        # reverse the second half
        node = None
        while slow:
            nxt = slow.next
            slow.next = node
            node = slow
            slow = nxt
        
        # compare the first and second half
        while node and head:
            if node.val != head.val:
                return False
            node = node.next
            head = head.next
            
        return True
```
