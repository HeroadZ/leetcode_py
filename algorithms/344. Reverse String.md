Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

### Example
```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString1(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s[:] = s[::-1]
    
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        if not s: return s
        
        l, r = 0, len(s)-1
        
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
```
