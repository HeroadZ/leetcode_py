Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1

```

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        longest = start = 0
        last_seen = {}
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in last_seen and last_seen[c] >= start:
                start = last_seen[c] + 1
            else:
                longest = max(longest, i-start+1)
            
            last_seen[c] = i
        
        return longest
```
