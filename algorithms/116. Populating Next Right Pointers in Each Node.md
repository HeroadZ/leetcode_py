You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.


Follow up:

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

### Example
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
```

### Solution

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    # O(2^(depth-1)) space
    def connect1(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        level = [root, None]
        
        while root and len(level) > 1:
            for i in range(len(level)-1):
                level[i].next = level[i+1]
            level = [kid for n in level[:-1] for kid in (n.left, n.right) if kid] + [None]
        
        return root
    
    # O(1) space
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        ans = root
        while root and root.left:
            nxt = root.left
            while root:
                root.left.next = root.right
                if root.next:
                    root.right.next = root.next.left
                else:
                    root.right.next = None
                root = root.next
            root = nxt
        return ans
```
