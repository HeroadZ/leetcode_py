Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Follow up:

- Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

### Example
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

### Solution
place each number in its final position, and keep the replaced number.

    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:

        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.

        N = len(nums)
