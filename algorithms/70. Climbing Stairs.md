You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

### Example
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution

it's a fibonacci.

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs1(self, n: int) -> int:
        ans = [None]*(n+1)
        ans[0] = 1
        ans[1] = 1
        return self.f(n, ans)
    
    def f(self, n, ans):
        if not ans[n]: 
            ans[n] = self.f(n-2, ans) + self.f(n-1, ans)
        return ans[n]
    
    # iterative
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a = b = 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a+b
        return a
