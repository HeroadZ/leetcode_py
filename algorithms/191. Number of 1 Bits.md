Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Example
```
Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight1(self, n: int) -> int:
        return bin(n).count('1')
    
    # n&n-1 will cancel the last 1
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        
        while n:
            n &= n-1
            cnt += 1
        
        return cnt
```
