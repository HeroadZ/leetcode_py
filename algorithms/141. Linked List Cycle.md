Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
### Example
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
```

### Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle1(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
    
    # try and except attributeError
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        try: 
            slow = head
            fast = head.next
            while slow is not fast:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
            return True
        except AttributeError:
            return False
```
