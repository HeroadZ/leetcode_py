Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example
```
Input: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]  
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    # one pass
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        d = {}
        
        for i, e in enumerate(nums):
            if target - e in d:
                return [d[target-e], i]
            d[e] = i
```
