Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

### Example
```
Input: 123
Output: 321

Input: -123
Output: -321

Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        s = (x>0) - (x<0)  # to get number sign
        r = int(str(s*x)[::-1]) # s*x makes it positive
        return s * r * (r<2**31) # prevent overflow
```
